                    <p>The student accurately identified several key causes and some effects of climate change. They included deforestation and industrial activities as causes, which are correct, and mentioned global warming as an effect, aligning with the answer key. However, they omitted rising sea levels explicitly, a point in the answer key that was not addressed. Additionally, while severe weather patterns were mentioned, it could be expanded to include specific examples like extreme temperatures or storms.</p>

                    <p>The industrial revolution happened directly after the french revolution. It was basically where urbanization, factory products and change in labour practices. it made lots more products go big boom. Also, it resulted in class barriers and socio economic problems for everyone. Child labour, domicile, global warming happened and earth suffered while humans thrived. Mass market things became good and small market things were killed.</p>
